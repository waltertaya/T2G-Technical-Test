## **Section 1: Algorithmic Thinking and Data Structures**

### **Problem:** Capitalize Each Word in a String

**Objective:**  
Write a program that takes a string as input, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and returns the result.

**Examples:**  
- Input: `"hi"`  
  Output: `"Hi"`  
- Input: `"i love programming"`  
  Output: `"I Love Programming"`  

**Implementation Details:**  
- **Languages Used:** Python, JavaScript.  
- **Approach:** The program splits the string into words, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and joins them back into a single string.  
- **Code Location:** Available in the `section1/main.py` directory.

**How to Test:**  
1. Run the script for Python or JavaScript.
2. Provide different test strings as input.

### **Project:** Build a Simple FAQ Accordion  

**Objective:**  
Create a basic FAQ accordion using only HTML and CSS.

---

### **Task Description:**

1. **What Youâ€™re Building:**  
   An FAQ component where users can interact with questions to reveal or hide corresponding answers.

2. **Requirements:**  
   - **Core Functionality:**  
     - Clicking on a question reveals its answer.  
     - Clicking on another question hides the previously visible answer (accordion behavior).  
   - **Responsive Design:**  
     - On mobile devices, the FAQ items should stack vertically.  
     - On larger screens (e.g., tablets or desktops), the FAQ layout should adapt for improved readability.

3. **Deliverables:**  
   - **Code Structure:**  
     - HTML for creating the structure of the FAQ accordion.  
     - CSS for styling and implementing the accordion functionality.  

---

### **How to Test:**  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `section2/index.html` file in your browser.  
3. Test the accordion for responsiveness by resizing the browser window.
